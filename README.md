My Emacs Configuration
======================

This is my `.emacs.el` file and releated files, together they
configure GNU Emacs the way I like it.

I'm trying to make the configuration work across operating systems,
that is Linux and Windows. I mostly use Linux, which means that
Windows support might be broken.

The configuration should work on recent versions of GNU Emacs.
