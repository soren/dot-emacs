;;; Commentary:

;; This file makes Emacs default to UTF-8 encoding.

;; Inspiration from
;; http://blog.jonnay.net/archives/820-Emacs-and-UTF-8-Encoding.html

;;; Code:

(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
(setq default-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)

(if (eq window-system 'x)
    (setq x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING)))

(if (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
    (set-clipboard-coding-system 'utf-16le-dos))
