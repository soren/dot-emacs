;; Set up python-mode with auto-complete and linting.

;; See https://www.pylint.org/
;; and https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

;;; Code:

;; Set up pylint integration using flycheck if both are installed
(when (and (featurep 'flycheck)
           (locate-file "pylint" exec-path exec-suffixes 'file-executable-p))
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode))

;; Set up jedi integration using company. This requires virtualenv to be installed
(when (and (featurep 'company)
           (locate-file "virtualenv" exec-path exec-suffixes 'file-executable-p))
  (unless (package-installed-p 'company-jedi)
    (package-install 'company-jedi))
  (jedi:install-server)
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-jedi))
